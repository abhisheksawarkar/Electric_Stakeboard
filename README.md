Electric_Stakeboard (PRO-BOARD)
===================

Pro board stands for ‘Pressure Relied orientation skateboard’. It is basically a skateboard which operates on the amount of pressure the rider applies on the pressure pads. High torque motors drive the skateboard forward. When the rider wishes to accelerate the board, he leans forward and puts pressure on the front sensor pad, which senses the amount of pressure. This analog pressure data is converted into digital signals which is then feed into the heart of the board, i.e. the Microcontroller.

Embedded C code for Micro-Controller is written in Programmer's notepad. The pressure sensors are called FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) which gives analog data to the micro-controller. ADC channel in the controller converts this analog value into digital values and drives the motors using PWM.
